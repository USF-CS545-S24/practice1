Consider the following array: 1, 0, 13, 50, 22, 14
If this is the result after the first partition of quicksort, which of these elements could have been the pivot?
1
0
13
50
22
14

Please select one of the options on Canvas.

Solution: 13 was used as the pivot.
Since for 13, all elements on the left  (1 and 0) are smaller than 13, and
all elements on the right  (50, 22, 14) are >= 13.
Other elements could not have been the pivot in this example.
