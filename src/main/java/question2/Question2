Give Theta of the running time (as a function of n) of the following code snippet and explain your answer.

public static int func2(int n) {
   int sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
   for (int m = 1; m <= n; m = m * 2) {
       for (int l = 1; l <= n; l = l + 4) {
           sum1++;
       }
   }

   for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
       for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) {
           sum2++;
       }
   }
   return sum1 * sum2;
}
