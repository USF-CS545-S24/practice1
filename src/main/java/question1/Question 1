Give Theta of the running time (as a function of n) of the following code snippet and explain your answer.
(Hint: you are expected to do a summation since the number of iterations of the "j loop" depends on i).

public static void func1(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = n - 1; j > i; j--) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[j-1]) {
                swap(j, j-1, arr);
            }
        }
    }
}
