Consider the following function:

public int func(int n) {

      if (n <= 1)

            return 1;

      else

            return func(n - 1) + func(n - 1);

}

(a) Give a recurrence relation for this function.


(b) Solve the recurrence relation using repeated substitution to get the big O of the running time.
